the NOUNd is being VERBed.
I have to VERBd the NOUNd.
I have to VERBd the NOUNd before the NOUNd VERBs.
this is classic NOUNd behaviour.
the NOUNd VERBobj.
they're trying to get through our NOUNd with a VERBn.
the hackers have broken though the NOUNd.
they're trying to VERBd our NOUNd.
things aren't looking good for our NOUNd.
VERBing the NOUNd.
NOUNa isn't designed for this.
they only have one NOUNd layer on their NOUNd.
their NOUNd will never see what hit 'em.
still getting used to the NOUNd on my NOUNd.
my NOUNd VERBobj.
I'm getting VERBed hard by this NOUNd.
it's only a joke when you're not the one getting your NOUNd VERBed by NOUNa when you accidentally VERBd into NOUNa NOUNd project.
I tried VERBing NOUNa's NOUNd last week.
he had defensive NOUNds installed, so I'm stuck with a VERBed NOUNd with no creds to show for it.
they've VERBed through our NOUNd NOUNd NOUNd.
sweet Jesus, that's NOUNa NOUNd NOUNd NOUNd.
I'm VERBing the NOUNd now.
bear with me while I VERBd through the NOUNd to VERBd the NOUNd.
NOUNd is complete garbage.
have you seen the new NOUNd?
I've never seen NOUNa VERBd like this before.
my old partner got VERBed by one of these NOUNds.
never thought I'd see NOUNa in my lifetime.
hah, has this guy even seen NOUNa before in his life?
I just have to use the NOUNd to VERBd their NOUNd and, yes, I've got them!
does this guy really think he's NOUNa master?
he couldn't VERBd his way out of NOUNa.
I'm tired of every low-rez datasucker with a stock NOUNd giving us a bad name.
NOUNa NOUNd NOUNd NOUNd NOUNd NOUNd, so that's their plan.
NOUNa? Pah, don't make me laugh.
this guy couldn't tell the difference between NOUNa and NOUNa!
this guy must be new to the NOUNd.
well, that's NOUNa for you.
I'm VERBing at the speed of light, baby, there's nothing this NOUNd can't do!
oh please, you think Lance "Ace" Cyberdrive doesn't know how to VERBd NOUNa?
you're way outta your league.
classic mistake.
this is the end, for them!
I've got them!
that's for sure.
you think that's rough?
this will be easy.
now that's a new one.
they're good.
these guys are good.
I thought it couldn't be done.
unbelievable.
this may take a moment.
sorry.
dammit!
fuck!
those sneaky bastards.
what a pain in my ass.
fucking jokers.
they're boned.
we're boned.
get bent, frag-face.
he's good.
he's really good.
never thought I'd see that in my lifetime.
get forked!
hub off, jerkwad.
don't worry.
nitro-scum.
you're cloggin' up the e-Road, pal!
listen, they don't call me Ace for nothin'.
interesting technique.
using NOUNa to VERBd the NOUNds systems?
impressive.
I gotta hand it to him.
where's a NetSloth like this learn to CyberSurf?
the Cyberhighway can't handle this load!
is he nuts?
hah, sometimes I amaze even myself.
ol' Ace has still got it, baby!
of course, why didn't I think of that before?
when was NOUNa capable of VERBing the NOUNd like that?
what was I thinking?
damn, I totally VERBed the NOUNd!
let's see how he handles this move.
a counter-drive!?
if I could just VERBd the NOUNd, I could then VERBd the NOUNd.
aha!
drat, Netcops on my tail!
this is risky, but there's no other way.
if I let him VERBd my NOUNd like that, my NOUNd will be VERBed to nothing more than NOUNa!
very clever.
buckle up, you're in for the ride of your life, pal!
let's see how you like the taste of your own medicine!
one false move and my NOUNds are VERBed!
gotta make this one count.
not bad.
end of the line, buddy.
NOUNd has reached maximum VERBn levels.
looks like my NOUNd has VERBd his NOUNd.
a VERBn.
it's VERBing.
this little baby VERBs every NOUNd in a 10-mile radius.
his NOUNd VERBobj.
I've never seen a VERBn like this.
not every NOUNd on the net can VERBd like that.
this guy's toast.
as expected of my nemesis, Nexus.
Nexus back to his old tricks.
go back to LightCycle school!
could he be working with SkyWeb?
he fell for it!
Nexus, I thought we'd never meet again.
this looks like the work of my nemesis, Nexus.
this is the power of the digital underworld.
it's a cyber revolution, baby!
